## Requirements
- You would need C/C++ Compiler like `Clang` or `GCC/G++` to edit and compile the `.cpp` file, but if you will only run the executable file then you don't need any compiler pre installed

---

## How to run
- if running the file normally
  ```bash
  ./main
  ```

- if editing and compiling
  ```bash
  # Compile with GCC/G++
  g++ -Wall -O2 -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main
  # Run the file
  ./main

  # Compile with Clang
  clang++ -Wall -O2 main.cpp -o main

  # Run the file
  ./main
  ```
